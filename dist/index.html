    <div class="biography">
        <p class="bio1"> » Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, known professionally as Halsey,
            is an American singer and songwriter. Gaining attention
            from self-released music on social media platforms, she was
            signed by Astralwerks in 2014. By early 2017 Halsey had released
            one studio album, one extended play, five singles and five music videos. </p>
        <p class="bio2"> » Halsey has sold 22 million records in the US alone,
            based on certifications alone. Her awards and nominations include four
            Billboard Music Awards, one GLAAD Media Award, a Guinness World Record,
            a MTV Video Music Award and a Grammy Award nomination. Halsey is noted 
            for her distinctive singing voice, and her music is usually based on her 
            personal experiences. Outside of her career, she has been involved in 
            suicide prevention awareness and sexual assault victim advocacy. </p>
        <p class="bio2"> » The New Jersey native took her moniker from a New York L
            train subway stop, and her adopted city plays a large role in both the
            sound and lyrics of her dark, gritty electro-pop. In 2015, she debuted
            with Badlands, which hit number two on the Billboard 200 chart and sold
            well. Continued success came in 2016, when her featured appearance on
            the Chainsmokers' "Closer"
            helped push the single to the top of the charts. In 2017, Halsey was back
            with Hopeless Fountain Kingdom, which topped the album chart At the end of 2018,
            she notched her first number one single as a lead artist, "Without Me." </p>
        <p class="bio2"> » She started 2019 with a series of high-profile collaborative
            singles including "11 Minutes" with Travis Barker and Yungblud, and "Boy
            with Luv" with K-pop superstars BTS. Promotion for her third full-length,
            Manic, started in earnest that spring. Singles "Nightmare" and "Graveyard"
            marked a darker, more introspective direction for the set, while third
            single "Without Me" became her first number one-charting single as main
            artist. </p>
